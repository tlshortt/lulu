# Requirements: Lulu

**Defined:** 2026-02-14
**Core Value:** Run and monitor multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously from a single dashboard

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Session Management

- [x] **SESS-01**: User can launch multiple named Claude Code sessions (3-5) that run in parallel - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **SESS-02**: User can view a dashboard list showing all sessions with name, status, and progress - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **SESS-03**: User can see session status at a glance (running, waiting for approval, completed, failed, interrupted) - Adjusted in v1.0 (approval-waiting removed with Phase 4 scope change)
- [x] **SESS-04**: Sessions persist across app restarts via SQLite storage - Validated in v1.0

### Session Output

- [x] **OUT-01**: User can click into any session to view its live streamed output (text, thinking, tool use, tool results) - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **OUT-02**: User can review session history and logs after completion - Validated in v1.0

### Working Directory & Git

- [x] **GIT-01**: Each session targets a configurable working directory - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **GIT-02**: Sessions use git worktrees to isolate parallel agents from conflicting - Validated in v1.0

### Security & Approvals

- [x] **APPR-01**: User sees approval prompts for tool operations not covered by auto-approve rules - Dropped from v1.0 (Phase 4 scrapped)
- [x] **APPR-02**: User can approve or reject pending tool calls from the UI - Dropped from v1.0 (Phase 4 scrapped)
- [x] **APPR-03**: User can define auto-approve rules using pattern matching (exact, prefix, wildcard) - Dropped from v1.0 (Phase 4 scrapped)
- [x] **APPR-04**: Tools matching auto-approve rules execute without manual prompt - Dropped from v1.0 (Phase 4 scrapped)

### Session Lifecycle

- [x] **LIFE-01**: User can interrupt a running session mid-execution - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **LIFE-02**: User can continue/resume a completed or interrupted session with a new prompt - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **LIFE-03**: One crashed session does not affect other running sessions - Validated in v1.0
- [x] **LIFE-04**: App handles session errors gracefully without crashing - Validated in v1.0

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### UX Enhancements

- **UX-01**: User can start sessions from templates/presets for common patterns
- **UX-02**: User can see token usage and cost per session
- **UX-03**: User can review visual side-by-side diffs before committing changes
- **UX-04**: User can see agent confidence scoring for task completion likelihood

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time collaboration / multi-user | Single-developer tool |
| Pipeline/chaining sessions | Parallel-only for v1 |
| Native terminal emulator | Sessions run via cc-sdk, not a terminal |
| CLI companion / HTTP API | Desktop app only for v1 |
| Fork sessions | Continue/resume is sufficient for v1 |
| Draft sessions (compose before running) | Direct launch is fine for v1 |
| Memory/learning system | Requires vector DB infrastructure, defer to v2+ |
| Cross-session coordination | Very complex, unclear user demand |
| Session teleport/handoff | Requires cloud backend |
| Slack/chat integration | Expands beyond desktop app scope |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SESS-01 | Phase 2, Phase 3 | Validated |
| SESS-02 | Phase 3 | Validated |
| SESS-03 | Phase 3 | Adjusted |
| SESS-04 | Phase 6 | Validated |
| OUT-01 | Phase 2 | Validated |
| OUT-02 | Phase 6 | Validated |
| GIT-01 | Phase 2 | Validated |
| GIT-02 | Phase 3 | Validated |
| APPR-01 | Phase 4 | Dropped |
| APPR-02 | Phase 4 | Dropped |
| APPR-03 | Phase 4 | Dropped |
| APPR-04 | Phase 4 | Dropped |
| LIFE-01 | Phase 5 | Validated |
| LIFE-02 | Phase 5 | Validated |
| LIFE-03 | Phase 3 | Validated |
| LIFE-04 | Phase 5 | Validated |

## Requirement Outcomes

- **Validated (11):** SESS-01, SESS-02, SESS-04, OUT-01, OUT-02, GIT-01, GIT-02, LIFE-01, LIFE-02, LIFE-03, LIFE-04.
- **Adjusted (1):** SESS-03 (approval-waiting state removed from active status vocabulary after Phase 4 scope removal).
- **Dropped (4):** APPR-01, APPR-02, APPR-03, APPR-04 (Phase 4 approval system removed from v1.0 scope).

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 16 total
- Mapped to phases: 16
- Unmapped: 0

**Coverage validation:**
- Phase 1: 0 requirements (infrastructure foundation)
- Phase 2: 3 requirements (SESS-01 partial, OUT-01, GIT-01)
- Phase 3: 5 requirements (SESS-01 complete, SESS-02, SESS-03, GIT-02, LIFE-03)
- Phase 4: 4 requirements (APPR-01, APPR-02, APPR-03, APPR-04)
- Phase 5: 3 requirements (LIFE-01, LIFE-02, LIFE-04)
- Phase 6: 2 requirements (SESS-04, OUT-02)

Total: 17 mappings for 16 requirements (SESS-01 spans Phase 2 and Phase 3)
